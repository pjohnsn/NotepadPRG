# Notepad_PROGRAMMER
I am a beginner programmer and have been learning about how to use Java since February 2015 of this year. However, I just started learning how to write code in the Python Language, a couple of weeks ago and find it to be much easier to work with. My goal here is to create a simple Note pad program from scratch using Python and I need assistance please. This will be my first full program created! I want to get my feet wet, and get used to writing programs so that I can possibly do Freelance work/projects. I have wrote some code layout already. Feel free to add code to make my program interact with user input.
